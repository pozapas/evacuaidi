## üî¨ Research Overview

This dissertation addresses critical gaps in evacuation science through four interconnected research contributions:

1. **AI Knowledge Extraction**: Automated parameter extraction from fire safety codes
2. **Disability-Inclusive Modeling**: Enhanced agent-based models for heterogeneous populations
3. **Causal Evaluation**: Quantifying the impact of AI guidance on evacuation performance
4. **Probabilistic Risk Assessment**: Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification

## üìä Key Findings

- **22.5%** reduction in evacuation time with AI guidance
- **15.9%** greater benefits for individuals with disabilities
- **92%+** accuracy in automated parameter extraction
- **57%** of risk variance attributed to occupant load

## üõ† Technology Stack

- HTML5/CSS3 with Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript with RAG-based AI chat
- Google Gemini API for dissertation Q&A
- Responsive design with interactive plot modals

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

### For GitHub Pages Deployment (Secure Method)

The site uses GitHub Secrets to inject API keys securely during deployment. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository settings**:
   - Navigate to `https://github.com/pozapas/evacuaidi-presentation/settings/secrets/actions`

2. **Add Repository Secrets**:
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Add these two secrets:
     - Name: `GEMINI_EMBEDDING_API_KEY`, Value: [Your Gemini embedding API key]
     - Name: `GEMINI_GENERATION_API_KEY`, Value: [Your Gemini generation API key]

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"

4. **Deploy**:
   - Push to main branch or manually trigger the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - The workflow will inject your API keys securely during build

### For Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pozapas/evacuaidi-presentation.git
   cd evacuaidi-presentation
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys** (Choose one method):

   **Method A: Local Config File (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example config
   cp config.local.example.js config.local.js
   
   # Edit config.local.js and add your Google Gemini API keys
   # This file is git-ignored for security
   ```

   **Method B: Environment File**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your Google Gemini API keys
   GEMINI_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=your_embedding_api_key_here
   GEMINI_GENERATION_API_KEY=your_generation_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Get Google Gemini API Keys**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key
   - You need both embedding and generation capabilities

4. **Serve the site locally**
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

5. **Open in browser**: `http://localhost:8000`

## ü§ñ AI Chat Feature

The site includes an AI research assistant that can answer questions about the dissertation:

- **RAG-based search**: Uses semantic embeddings to find relevant dissertation content
- **Context-aware responses**: Provides specific data and findings from the research
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask about methodology, findings, implications, and technical details

### Sample Questions
- "What are the main research contributions of EvacuAIDi?"
- "How much does AI guidance improve evacuation times?"
- "What are the benefits for people with disabilities?"
- "Explain the DiSFM-GS model and its validation"

## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: For production use, consider implementing a backend proxy to hide API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Google Gemini API has usage limits
- **CORS**: Current setup works for client-side only applications
