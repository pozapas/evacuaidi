# EvacuAIDi: AI-Driven Evacuation Framework

An AI-driven, causal-informed framework for probabilistic and disability-inclusive evacuation guidance.

## ðŸ“– About

This is the presentation website for the PhD dissertation "EvacuAIDi: An AI-Driven, Causal-Informed Framework for Probabilistic and Disability-Inclusive Evacuation Guidance" by Amir Rafe at Utah State University (2025).

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

## ðŸ¤– AI Chat Feature

The website includes an interactive AI research assistant that can answer questions about the dissertation. The AI uses:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for accurate, context-aware responses
- **Google Gemini API** for embeddings and text generation
- **Secure backend proxy** to protect API keys from users

### ðŸ”§ Deployment Options

#### For GitHub Pages (Secure - Recommended)
1. **Deploy backend to Vercel** (keeps API keys secure)
2. **See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** for complete step-by-step guide
3. **Benefits:** API keys protected, free hosting, professional setup

#### For Local Development Only
1. **Update `api-config.js`** with your API keys
2. **Open `index.html`** in browser
3. **Warning:** Never commit API keys to public repositories

### ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- **GitHub Pages Version:** Uses secure backend proxy (API keys hidden)
- **Local Development:** API keys visible in code (development only)
- **Production Ready:** Secure deployment protects your API usage and costs

## ï¿½ðŸ”¬ Research Overview

This dissertation addresses critical gaps in evacuation science through four interconnected research contributions:

1. **AI Knowledge Extraction**: Automated parameter extraction from fire safety codes
2. **Disability-Inclusive Modeling**: Enhanced agent-based models for heterogeneous populations
3. **Causal Evaluation**: Quantifying the impact of AI guidance on evacuation performance
4. **Probabilistic Risk Assessment**: Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- **22.5%** reduction in evacuation time with AI guidance
- **15.9%** greater benefits for individuals with disabilities
- **92%+** accuracy in automated parameter extraction
- **57%** of risk variance attributed to occupant load
