## ðŸ”¬ Research Overview

This dissertation addresses critical gaps in evacuation science through four interconnected research contributions:

1. **AI Knowledge Extraction**: Automated parameter extraction from fire safety codes
2. **Disability-Inclusive Modeling**: Enhanced agent-based models for heterogeneous populations
3. **Causal Evaluation**: Quantifying the impact of AI guidance on evacuation performance
4. **Probabilistic Risk Assessment**: Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- **22.5%** reduction in evacuation time with AI guidance
- **15.9%** greater benefits for individuals with disabilities
- **92%+** accuracy in automated parameter extraction
- **57%** of risk variance attributed to occupant load
